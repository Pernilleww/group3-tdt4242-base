## Local setup
It's recommended to have a look at: https://www.djangoproject.com/start/
Just as important is the Django REST guide: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/

Create a virtualenv https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/


### Django

Installation with examples for Ubuntu. Windows and OSX is mostly the same

Fork the project and clone it to your machine.

#### Setup and activation of virtualenv (env that prevents python packages from being installed globaly on the machine)
Naviagate into the project folder, and create your own virtual environment


#### Install python requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Migrate database

`python manage.py migrate`


#### Create superuser

Create a local admin user by entering the following command:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Only username and password is required


#### Start the app

`python manage.py runserver`


#### Add initial data

You can add initial data either by going to the url the app is running on locally and adding `/admin` to the url.

Add some categories and you should be all set.

Or by entering 

`python manage.py loaddata seed.json`

### Cordova
Cordova CLI guide: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/
If you want to run this as a mobile application
- Navigate to the frontend directory
- For android, do `cordova run android`
- For ios, do `cordova run ios`
- For browser, do `cordova run browser`

It's possible you will need to add the platforms you want to run and build.
The following documentation can be used to run the application in an Android emulator: \
https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html

## Tests

### Django

To run test for backend enter
`python manage.py test`


With coverage:
`coverage run manage.py test`

`coverage report -m ./users/serializers.py ./workouts/permissions.py`


### Cypress

To run the test in cypress go to the frontend folder and enter in different terminals:

`npm run test:dev`

`npm run django:testserver`

`npm run cypress:open`
